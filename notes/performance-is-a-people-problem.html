        <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
        <section>
          <p>
            When people talk about performance, they often jump straight to
            code. Frameworks, bundles, tooling, Lighthouse scores. But in my
            experience, performance problems show up much earlier, and much
            higher up, than the codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve seen this clearly in a frontend-only team I worked with. The
            team originally had a technical manager who was leading delivery and
            also acting as the primary point of contact externally. Over time,
            that setup changed. The manager stepped back from being the primary
            interface, one of their reportees was brought forward as the new
            face of the team, and a third person was added to take on parts of
            the original role.
          </p>
          <p>
            On paper, this looked like a reasonable transition. In reality, it
            created a mess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three different people were now “leading” the same team. Ownership
            became blurry. Accountability became optional. Engineers got
            conflicting directions, deadlines slipped, morale dropped, and
            people weren’t sure who ultimately made decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing was wrong with the frontend stack. Nothing was blocked
            technically. Performance dropped anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s when it became obvious: when three people are responsible, no
            one really is. Blurred ownership is one of the fastest ways to kill
            team performance. A single clear owner matters more than any tool or
            process tweak.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Common misconceptions -->
        <section>
          <h2>Common misconceptions about performance</h2>
          <p>
            When performance drops, teams rarely look at how decisions are being
            made. They look for something safe to blame.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Legacy code” is often the first target. It sounds technical and
            reasonable. But legacy code doesn’t decide priorities, doesn’t
            negotiate scope, or avoid ownership. I’ve seen the same codebase
            move fast under one setup and crawl under another. Code becomes a
            problem when no one feels responsible for improving or containing
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing requirements are next. Yes, requirements change. They
            always have, and they always will. Treating that as the root cause
            is lazy. The real issue is usually that no one owns trade-offs. When
            teams accept every change without re-scoping, re-prioritizing, or
            pushing back, performance degrades by design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scope creep with reduced timelines is often framed as bad luck or
            external pressure. In reality, it’s a leadership failure. If
            everything is critical and nothing can move, then decisions aren’t
            being made, they’re being avoided. Engineers end up
            context-switching, cutting corners, and burning out, while delivery
            slows down anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s the uncomfortable truth: most performance problems survive
            because blaming systems is easier than fixing ownership.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            These explanations feel comforting because they externalize the
            problem. But they miss the point. Performance doesn’t collapse
            because of code, requirements, or timelines. It collapses when
            ownership is diluted and accountability is spread thin enough that
            no one feels responsible for the outcome.
          </p> -->
        </section>

        <!-- Section 3: People and factors -->
        <section>
          <h2>What actually affects performance</h2>
          <p>
            In high-performing teams, clarity shows up early and daily.
            Priorities are clear at the start of the day. When something new
            becomes important, something else is deliberately deprioritized.
            Performance improves not because people work harder, but because
            they’re allowed to focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strong teams also have a single direction. This doesn’t mean one
            person does everything, but it does mean there’s one clear voice
            setting priorities. Shared leadership sounds healthy in theory, but
            in practice it can mean multiple owners pulling in different
            directions. When that happens, engineers lose the ability to say no,
            and delivery becomes a negotiation instead of execution.
          </p>
          <p>
            In struggling teams, the warning signs show up quickly. Internal
            conflicts between multiple “owners” over priorities are common.
            Meetings multiply, but decisions don’t. You’ll often see someone
            unofficially playing the role of peacemaker, spending time aligning
            people instead of moving work forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where performance quietly leaks. Engineers start separating
            “real work” from “political work”. People wait instead of acting
            because acting without alignment feels risky. None of this shows up
            in metrics immediately, but it compounds over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Team behavior is defined by ownership: who decides, who commits, and
            who takes responsibility when things go wrong.

          <h2>Takeaways / Advice</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Single-point ownership matters more than process or
                tools.</strong
              >
              When multiple people claim responsibility, accountability
              evaporates, decisions stall, and delivery slows down.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prioritize clearly and visibly.</strong> Teams perform
              best when daily priorities are explicit, and when new tasks
              arrive, something else is deliberately de-prioritized.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ownership drives behavior.</strong> Engineers act
              confidently when it’s clear who decides and who owns outcomes;
              confusion leads to hesitation, misalignment, and friction.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Hard decisions around ownership are uncomfortable. Spotting the
            problem is rarely straightforward, and correcting it takes time.
            I’ve been part of teams where no one wanted to make that call,
            myself included. But every time performance improved, it started
            with someone finally taking responsibility for clarifying ownership.
