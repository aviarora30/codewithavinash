        <!-- Intro -->
        <section>
          <p>
            I recently started learning n8n and agentic AI systems, and it made
            me realise how constrained most conventional learning formats are.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most learning channels I’ve used over the years have a fixed shape.
            Articles. Documentation. Videos. Even instructor-led sessions, while
            interactive, usually follow a predefined flow. You can ask
            questions, but only within the boundaries of the material and the
            time available.
          </p>

          <p>
            That structure works well early in a career. Over time, especially
            as experience grows, it starts to feel restrictive. Real learning
            becomes less linear, but the formats don’t adapt.
          </p>

          <p>
            What changed with AI wasn’t just speed. It was the shape of learning
            itself.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: A different shape of learning -->
        <section>
          <h2>A different shape of learning</h2>

          <p>
            With AI, learning no longer feels like moving from chapter to
            chapter. It feels more like a conversation that keeps reshaping
            itself based on where I’m stuck, what I already know, and what I’m
            curious about next.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don’t have to translate my confusion into the “right” question. I
            can dump half-formed thoughts, wrong assumptions, and partial ideas,
            and still move forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            In that sense, it feels like a tailor-made course, rewritten in real
            time, just for how I think.
          </p>

          <p>That flexibility is genuinely powerful.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: The hidden cost -->
        <section>
          <h2>The hidden cost</h2>

          <p>
            That sounds like a win, and in many ways it is. But some of the most
            durable lessons I’ve learned over the years didn’t come from
            answers. They came from mistakes that taught me things I didn’t even
            know I needed yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Traditional learning environments have friction built into them. You
            misunderstand a concept. You apply it wrong. You hit a wall. And
            only then do you realise what was missing in your understanding.
          </p>

          <p>AI removes many of those walls and blockers automatically.</p>

          <p>
            Sometimes that’s helpful. More often, it quietly removes the
            struggle that would have shaped your thinking.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: Manufactured friction -->
        <section>
          <h2>Manufactured friction</h2>

          <p>
            This is where the idea of manufactured friction starts to matter.
          </p>

          <p>
            When learning becomes too efficient, you don’t naturally sit with
            confusion long enough. You move on before the lesson has really sunk
            in. You get something that works, but you’re not always sure why it
            works.
          </p>

          <p>Over time, that can affect long-term craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>
            Deep skill isn’t just about arriving at correct answers. It’s about
            building intuition, judgment, and taste. Those things usually grow
            slower, through resistance, not acceleration.
          </p>

          <p>
            If AI removes friction by default, we may need to reintroduce some
            of it intentionally.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: A more deliberate way -->
        <section>
          <h2>A more deliberate way to learn with AI</h2>

          <p>
            This isn’t an argument against AI-assisted learning. I’m using it,
            and I’ll continue to use it.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I’m starting to treat it less like an answer engine and more
            like a thinking partner. Sometimes that means asking it to slow
            down. Sometimes it means resisting the urge to accept the first
            “good enough” solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal isn’t to struggle unnecessarily. It’s to struggle where it
            matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because in the long run, the quality of what you build depends on
            how deeply the learning reshaped how you think.
