        <!-- Section 1: Introduction + early observations (no heading) -->
        <section>
          <p>
            I recently started learning n8n and agentic AI systems, and it
            highlighted how rigid most conventional learning formats are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most learning channels I’ve used over the years have a fixed shape:
            articles, documentation, videos. Even instructor-led sessions, while
            interactive, usually follow a predefined flow. You can ask
            questions, but only within the boundaries of the material and the
            time available.
          </p>
          <p>
            That structure works well early in a career. Over time, especially
            as experience grows, it starts to feel restrictive. Real learning
            becomes less linear, but the formats don’t adapt.
          </p>
          <p>Using AI as the primary learning tool changed that.</p>
          <p>
            What changed with AI wasn’t just speed. It was the shape of learning
            itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of consuming a predefined course or resource, learning
            started to feel like an ongoing conversation. One that adapts to my
            experience level and responds to where I’m stuck, rather than
            forcing me to follow a fixed sequence.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could branch in any direction without planning for it in advance.
            Ask a clarification question midway, zoom out to understand the
            broader context, or slow things down and take one step at a time.
            The path wasn’t linear anymore, and that felt closer to how I
            actually think when learning something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that sense, it feels like a tailor-made course, rewritten in real
            time, just for how I think.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: AI strengths -->
        <section>
          <h2>What AI is genuinely good at for learning</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest benefit isn’t speed. It’s staying with a problem without
            breaking momentum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier, getting unstuck meant context switching: searching
            articles, scanning documentation, skimming videos, and mentally
            stitching things together. Often, by the time I found the answer, I
            had already lost the thread of what I was learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            With AI, I can stay inside the problem. I can ask a question at the
            exact point of confusion and get an explanation that fits the
            context I’m already in.
          </p>
          <p>This has been most useful for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Getting unstuck when something doesn’t work and the reason isn’t
              obvious
            </li>
            <li>
              Understanding new concepts by relating them to things I already
              know
            </li>
            <li>
              Exploring adjacent ideas without committing to a full deep dive
            </li>
            <li>
              Controlling pace, moving fast when things are clear and slowing
              down when they’re not
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The value here isn’t completeness. It’s continuity. Learning feels
            less like jumping between resources and more like extending the same
            line of thought until it makes sense.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 3: Trade-offs and friction -->
        <section>
          <h2>The uncomfortable trade-off</h2>
          <p>
            One thing I didn’t expect was how few mistakes I started making
            while learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI reduces friction so effectively that many small failures simply
            don’t happen. When something goes wrong, it’s easy to ask for an
            explanation or a fix and move on. That sounds like a win, and in
            many ways it is. But some of the most durable lessons I’ve learned
            over the years didn’t come from answers. They came from mistakes
            that taught me things I didn’t even know I needed yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those lessons often showed up as a broken assumption, an unexpected
            constraint, or a side effect that only surfaced because I took a
            wrong turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            When learning was slower and more manual, these lessons appeared
            accidentally. I’d run into a problem, fix it, and come away with an
            understanding that paid off much later in a different context.
          </p>
          <p>
            With AI, learning becomes highly intentional. You mostly learn what
            you ask for. That makes learning focused and efficient, but also
            narrower. Intentional exploration is harder than accidental
            discovery, and I have to consciously create space for it now.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 4: Learning style changes -->
        <section>
          <h2>What changed in my learning style</h2>
          <p>
            AI makes learning smoother and more controlled. To balance that, I
            now introduce friction intentionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            When something feels too easy or resolves too quickly, I slow down
            on purpose. I spend extra time understanding why something works, or
            try to do parts of it without asking for help, just to see where I
            struggle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier, friction appeared naturally through mistakes and dead ends.
            Now, I have to manufacture it. Depth no longer emerges accidentally;
            it requires conscious effort.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 5: Audience reflection -->
        <section>
          <h2>For mid-senior engineers and managers</h2>
          <p>
            For experienced learners, the risk isn’t misinformation. It’s
            premature clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            When answers come too easily, it’s tempting to move on before the
            idea has fully settled. Over time, that can quietly flatten
            intuition. You still solve problems and ship outcomes, but you
            accumulate fewer of the small, hard-earned heuristics that come from
            sitting with confusion and making wrong turns. That’s a subtle cost,
            but it matters for long-term craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>A few principles I’m trying to keep in mind:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don’t outsource confusion too early. Sitting with uncertainty
              often reveals better questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use AI to explore, not to bypass thinking. If something feels
              unclear, ask why before asking how.
            </li>
            <li>
              Slow down deliberately when things feel obvious. Obvious is often
              where assumptions hide.
            </li>
            <li>
              Occasionally struggle through a problem without asking. The
              friction is part of the learning.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            None of this is about rejecting AI. It’s about using it in a way
            that respects how expertise actually forms over time.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 6: Open questions -->
        <section>
          <h2>Open questions</h2>
          <p>I’m still unsure where this leads in the long run.</p>
          <p>
            If learning becomes increasingly intentional and guided, what
            happens to the kind of intuition that forms through accidents and
            detours? Does it matter, or does new intuition form in different
            ways?
          </p>
          <p>
            Will we get better at manufacturing the right kind of friction, or
            will convenience slowly win out? And if it does, what do we lose
            that’s hard to measure today?
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t have answers yet. For now, I’m treating AI as a powerful
            learning companion, not a replacement for struggle. I’m paying
            attention to what it accelerates, and what it quietly removes.
          </p>
          <p>That feels like a good place to pause.</p>
