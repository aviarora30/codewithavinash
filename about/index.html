        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
          I’m Avinash Arora, an engineering leader with
          <strong>17 years of experience</strong> building and scaling frontend
          systems and teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started my career hands-on, writing code for games, e-learning, and
          web platforms, and gradually moved into leadership roles where the
          real challenge was not just shipping software, but building teams that
          could sustain it.
        </p>

          <h2>How I think about engineering</h2>
          <p>
            I value pragmatic architecture, systems that evolve well over time,
            and engineers who understand why decisions are made, not just how.

          <p>
