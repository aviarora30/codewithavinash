        <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
        <section>
          <p>
            When people talk about performance, they often jump straight to
            code. Frameworks, bundles, tooling, Lighthouse scores. But in my
            experience, performance problems show up much earlier, and much
            higher up, than the codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve seen this clearly in a frontend-only team I worked with. The
            team originally had a technical manager who was leading delivery and
            also acting as the primary point of contact externally. Over time,
            that setup changed. The manager stepped back from being the primary
            interface, one of their reportees was brought forward as the new
            face of the team, and a third person was added to take on parts of
            the original role.
          </p>
          <p>
            On paper, this looked like a reasonable transition. In reality, it
            created a mess.
          </p>
          <p>
            At one point, three different people were involved in “leading” the
            same team and delivery. Ownership became blurry. Accountability
            became optional. Engineers started getting conflicting directions.
            Deadlines slipped. Morale dropped. People weren’t sure who to align
            with or who ultimately made decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing was wrong with the frontend stack. Nothing was blocked
            technically. Performance dropped anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s when it became obvious: when three people are responsible, no
            one really is. Blurring ownership and accountability boundaries is
            one of the fastest ways to kill team performance. A single clear
            owner matters more than any tool, framework, or process tweak.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Common misconceptions -->
        <section>
          <h2>Common misconceptions about performance</h2>
          <p>
            When performance drops, teams rarely look at how decisions are being
            made. They look for something safe to blame.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Legacy code” is usually the first target. It sounds technical,
            reasonable, and hard to argue with. But legacy code doesn’t decide
            priorities, doesn’t negotiate scope, and doesn’t avoid ownership.
            I’ve seen the same codebase move fast under one setup and crawl
            under another. Code becomes a problem when no one feels responsible
            for improving or containing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing requirements are next. Yes, requirements change. They
            always have, and they always will. Treating that as the root cause
            is lazy. The real issue is usually that no one owns trade-offs. When
            teams accept every change without re-scoping, re-prioritizing, or
            pushing back, performance degrades by design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scope creep with reduced timelines is often framed as bad luck or
            external pressure. In reality, it’s a leadership failure. If
            everything is critical and nothing can move, then decisions aren’t
            being made, they’re being avoided. Engineers end up
            context-switching, cutting corners, and burning out, while delivery
            slows down anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s the uncomfortable truth: most performance problems survive
            because blaming systems is easier than fixing ownership.
          </p>
          <p>
            These explanations feel comforting because they externalize the
            problem. But they miss the point. Performance doesn’t collapse
            because of code, requirements, or timelines. It collapses when
            ownership is diluted and accountability is spread thin enough that
            no one feels responsible for the outcome.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 3: People and factors -->
        <section>
          <h2>People and factors that actually affect performance</h2>
          <p>
            In teams that perform well, clarity shows up early and daily.
            Priorities are clear at the start of the day, not discovered halfway
            through it. And when something new becomes important, something else
            is deliberately taken off the team’s plate. Performance improves not
            because people work harder, but because they’re allowed to focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strong teams also have a single direction. This doesn’t mean one
            person does everything, but it does mean there’s one clear voice
            setting priorities. Shared leadership sounds healthy in theory, but
            in practice it often translates to multiple owners pulling the team
            in different directions. When that happens, engineers lose the
            ability to say no, and delivery becomes a negotiation instead of
            execution.
          </p>
          <p>
            In poorly performing teams, the warning signs show up quickly.
            Internal conflicts between multiple “owners” over priorities are
            common, and each usually has their own agenda. Meetings multiply,
            but decisions don’t. You’ll often see someone unofficially playing
            the role of peacemaker, spending time aligning people instead of
            moving work forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where performance quietly leaks. Engineers start separating
            “real work” from “political work.” Delivery priorities get mixed
            with personal priorities. People wait instead of acting because
            acting without alignment feels risky. None of this shows up in
            metrics immediately, but it compounds over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Team behavior is defined by ownership: who decides, who commits, and
            who takes responsibility when things go wrong.

              <strong

              When multiple people claim responsibility, accountability
              evaporates, decisions stall, and delivery slows down.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prioritize clearly and visibly.</strong> Teams perform
              best when daily priorities are explicit, and when new tasks
              arrive, something else is deliberately de-prioritized.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ownership drives behavior.</strong> Engineers act
              confidently when it’s clear who decides and who owns outcomes;
              confusion leads to hesitation, misalignment, and friction.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Closing thought:</strong> Hard decisions are never easy.
            Identifying ownership gaps is tricky, and fixing them often takes
            longer than anyone expects. I’ve been in teams where no one wanted
            to make the call, including me, but that is exactly what needs to
            happen for performance to improve.
