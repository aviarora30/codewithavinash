          </p>

          <p>
            I design, build, and scale frontend systems used by real teams and
            real users. Over the last <strong>17 years</strong>, I’ve worked
            across OTT, e-commerce, gaming, finance, and media platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of my work sits at the intersection of frontend architecture,
            performance, and people.
